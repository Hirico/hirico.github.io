      <description>When we are talking about understanding a subject, it&amp;rsquo;s important to recognize that understanding has different levels and different aspects.
One way to gauge one person&amp;rsquo;s understanding is to see what questions about the subject can he/she answer. Take React flux for example: what are the signatures of its APIs? What problem is it trying to solve? What characteristics of React/Web determine its necessity? Who invented it? What is its pros &amp;amp; cons?</description>

      <description>When I write code, it happens now and then that I forget some syntax or API, and typically I will ask google (type the question in the chrome address bar) instead of checking documentation.
When I use my laptop with a mouse connected, I often turn to touchpad to accomplish small tasks. It’s known that some veteran programmers don’t use either, keeping their hands on the keyboard.
Why would I make these decisions?</description>
