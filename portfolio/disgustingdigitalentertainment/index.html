         <h1>Disgusting Digital Entertainment</h1>
         <p>This is a writing practice, which I hope my roommates can someday find and read.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Modern society has witnessed the rise of a generation that lose themselves in digital entertainment. Holding a neutral attitude toward social norm - which may be a &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; in today&rsquo;s globalization trends - and unfortunately unconscious of their losing competence, some people argues there is much benefit which can be only gained from digital entertainment, and there is nothing wrong as long as &ldquo;you control your time&rdquo;. However, this excuse for their temptation, also as a misleading slogan for immature teenagers, is so defective that I can give a handful of arguments against it.</p>

<p>To begin with, let&rsquo;s define Digital Entertainment in this essay. It&rsquo;s a spectrum of certain repetitive activities involving human-computer interaction, which have their own generative rules. In a typical one of them, there will be a task which will never happen in the real life, at least in the foreseealbe future, requiring some unique skill, assigned to Mr.human, and over the course of playing, the system will reward our skilled Mr.human with something that will no way be helpful to Mr.human&rsquo;s productive life.</p>

<p>One misconception is, entertainment helps us unleash our primitive desire so it must be good for our health, and therefore playing is a good thing. I&rsquo;ll grant that achieving biological harmony is essential to have a healthy life, but this argument somehow assumes working is evil, because only when you assume that can you get the conclusion that &ldquo;conforming to the temptation is a good thing&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s definitely wrong that people must suffer to earn money, and if someone really think that way, he had better consider changing a job, because with an unhappy mind, he empirically won&rsquo;t make much achievement in that position and there are so many options in the world.</p>

<p>Another argument sounds more rational, which is it can help train our certain ability and recharge our brain to meander on the Internet and play video games. What they ignored is time efficiency as well as effectiveness. Although there is research showing playing first-person shooting game help cultivate an agile mind, it takes fair time per week to improve by a small rate. Technically, Netflix TV series like House of Cards are resources to learn English, but one can definitely learn more by focusing himself on structured study, since after watching a TV series what left in his memory are more likely dominated by the plots and characters, rather than English knowledge.</p>

<p>With regard to ways to recharge our brain after work, there are tons of well-made educational videos on YouTube which deserves a look. I always think understanding other subjects a little deeply through lectures can bring us significant amount of insights back to our daily work. As a software engineer, I found watching psychology lectures provided me a in-depth view into my teammates&rsquo; as well as our users&rsquo; behavior, which really help me cope with some tricky situations. No way can playing trivial multiplayer games give me those benefits.</p>

<p>Supporters might have not given up yet, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t want to improve myself in the free time, and I see there no harm to my cognition if I play video games&rdquo;. Assume most games are chess-like, I find <a href="https://medium.com/message/why-chess-will-destroy-your-mind-78ad1034521f">this article</a> a graceful antithesis.</p>

<p>Based on the proved unsoundness of all supportive arguments, and plausible alternative ways to truly harness our spare time, one can handily draw a conclusion that Digital Entainment is nothing but poison, which is exactly my point of view.</p>
