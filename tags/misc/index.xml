      <title>Understand Understanding</title>

      <description>When we are talking about understanding a subject, it&amp;rsquo;s important to recognize that understanding has different levels and different aspects.
One way to gauge one person&amp;rsquo;s understanding is to see what questions about the subject can he/she answer. Take React Flux for example: what are the signatures of its APIs? What problem is it trying to solve? What characteristics of React/Web determine its necessity? Who invented it? What is its pros &amp;amp; cons?</description>

      <description>I once thought the notion of narrowing your scope is only a term amongst incompetent researchers, and real masters will address large, interdisciplinary, nuanced problems in sound ways.
Turns out I was biased by public-oriented materials. Senior intellectuals communicate their grand thoughts, philosophies and opinions via public platforms like social media, blogs and talks, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean their published works which built their recognition are grand.
Intellectuals could easily let any grand theory fall apart, due to we human&amp;rsquo;s limited and brittle knowledge about the world.</description>

      <title>Language and thinking</title>

      <description>When we ruminate, how intensely should we use language?
Based on my experience on EL (a game development competition) and many other thrilling moments, it&amp;rsquo;s often when I break the frame of language, take the underlying instinct, and let the instinct flow in its natural way, that I feel most productive and powerful.
But using language has its own benefit. Language is paradigm, which helps us confine thoughts to successful patterns.</description>

      <description>When I write code, it happens now and then that I forget some syntax or API, and typically I will ask google (type the question in the chrome address bar) instead of checking documentation.
When I use my laptop with a mouse connected, I often turn to touchpad to accomplish small tasks. It’s known that some veteran programmers don’t use either, keeping their hands on the keyboard.
Why would I make these decisions?</description>
